This repository contains code used for the Intoduction to CNNs workshop by UQ AIML on the 12th of August 2021

The jupyter notebook file has instructions and explanations for the different code bits.

The really_good_model.ptcnn file is a model trained prior to the workshop that produced good results, it has been saved as a file to be reused. (The last section in the jupyter notebook shows instructions on how to load the file)
